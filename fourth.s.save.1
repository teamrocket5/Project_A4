@Fourth program for team rocket
@This program compute the following if statement construct:
	
.section .data
x: .word 1 @32-bit signed integer, can also use int directive instead of .word
.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
	ldr r1, =x	
	ldr r1, [r1]

	cmp r1, #3	
	ble lte
	bge gte
lte:
	sub r1, #1
	ldr r2, =x
	str r1, [r2]
	
gte:
	sub r1,#2	@Program Termination: exit syscall
	ldr 		@Program Termination: wake kernel
	.end
